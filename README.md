# Major-Route-Turn-Detection-through-Shape-Simplification

Major turns along a route are crucial for acquiring spatial knowledge. These turns indicate significant changes in direction along the path, making them critical reference points for navigation. They provide users with a sense of progress and direction, allowing them to mentally organize the route and make predictions about what lies ahead. To effectively identify these crucial direction changes, shape simplification can be employed. The objective of shape simplification is to reduce the complexity of the route by eliminating any irrelevant geometric details and simplifying it to its essential geometric form. This simplification facilitates spatial learning by making it easier to remember and recognize the essential features of a route. One method for shape simplification is the discrete curve evolution algorithm, which iteratively removes the least important kinks from the geometric figure. This algorithm aims to simplify the route to its most basic geometric form while preserving its essential features.
